# Purpose
This app was designed to educate users on how Cryptocurrency works. The app is a simulation to teach users how to transfer cryptocurrency from a marketplace to a private wallet.

# Users
Our target users are people who want to learn about cryptocurrency in a completely safe environment with no credit card numbers and no market crashes. The market allows the user to push a button to get some virtual dollars, then use those dollars to buy virtual cryptocurrency. The user will then be able to send TeachCoin from the marketplace to their wallet.

# Features
  # Register/Login
  Completion of the registration forms activates two tutorial slides which explain in simple terms what the app does and how to use it. After reading the slides, the user can log in and view their dashboard.
  
  # DashBoard
  The dashboard shows the user their dollar balance and some information about the app, as well as some additional links to other educational sites under "Resources" near the bottom of the page. This is the main page of the app. From the top of the dashboard, by using the navigation bar and clicking on the included links, the user has access to the wallet, the marketplace, notifications, and logout button. 
  
  # Marketplace
  The marketplace is where the user is able to generate dollars, trade dollars for TeachCoin, and send TeachCoin to their wallet. Here the user is presented with two forms. The first form displays the user's dollar balance, TeachCoin balance, and the price of TeachCoin. The two options in this form are to generate dollars and to Buy TeachCoin with some dollars. The second form allows the user to send TeachCoin to their wallet address, which is randomly generated for each user.
  
  # Wallet
  The wallet is where the user's unique wallet address is held. Upon purchasing TeachCoin, the user will go to this page, copy the address, and paste it into the submit form in the Marketplace page. Once that is finished, the user can navigate to the wallet to see the TeachCoin balance and all the coins they have purchased.
  
  # Notifications
  Once a new user registers and logs in, they are sent to the Dashboard page, which generates two notifications. Upon purchase of TeachCoin and purchase of dollars, the user is given additional notifications.
